docker-compose up --scale config-client-test=3 --scale config-server-test=2 &

to kill a docker container:

docker kill springcloud_config-server-test_1

Observations:
When a client is started it connects to the config server to bring all the configuration from the git hub repository.
When a client is started all the properties referenced by @Value are resolved and if you stop the server config...and you try to
recover a property from @Autowired private org.springframework.core.env.Environment environment object you can recover the property
because the property is brought from the git hub repo and that configuration is known by the client besides the config server is
down...you can scale the config server of course ...but I think that is going to be useful when you have a webhook to receive
the messages from git hub and send them to the services instances.
