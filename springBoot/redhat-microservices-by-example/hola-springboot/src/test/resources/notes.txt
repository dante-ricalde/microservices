# to build the project and deploy it to local kubernetes

# to describe a specific pod
	describe pod/hola-springboot-92xgj
# to delete all the pieces of the hola-springboot project, namely to delete all objects matching

# to describe a service
	oc describe svc hola-springboot
	oc describe svc/backend
# to describe the replication controller
	oc describe rc hola-springboot

	oc scale rc/hola-springboot --replicas=3
# to test the app
	http://hola-springboot-microservice-book.192.168.42.148.nip.io/api/greeting
	This is the hostname (Route/Node) create for the service hola-springboot

	another way to get the app is http://192.168.42.148:31040/api/greeting using the another port, if you have scale the service to 3 (oc scale rc/hola-springboot --replicas=3),
	you would retrieve the response from ips:172.17.0.5, 172.17.0.4 y 172.17.0.6 por example if we have these ips for our 3 pods resulted from scaling our service
	
# The cluster IP of the service hola-springboot is, you can retrieve by (oc describe svc/hola-springboot)
	172.30.32.165
	
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
# the environment variables that we define are passed to the first pod created, to see the environment
# variables in the pod you need to describe the pod and you will se the env variables of the pod
	Environment Variables:
      GREETING_BACKENDSERVICEHOST:	backend
      GREETING_BACKENDSERVICEPORT:	80
      GREETING_SAYING:			Hi from hola-springboot microservice built using Spring Boot
# the when you scale the service (in this case hola-springboot) all the pods scaled will have those enviroment
# variables, I think that those environment variables are inside the image of the microservice beside being in
# the pod

# to expose	a pod locally to be able to communicate with the pod over our localhost port 9000 for debugging.
	oc port-forward -p hola-springboot-76p54 9000:8080 (this technique works great even across a
	remote Kubernetes cluster, not just on our local CDK)
	to test it:
	* http://localhost:9000/api/hola
	In this case the pod hola-springboot-76p54 is running in the IP: 172.17.0.3 and when We test the endpoint /api/hola 
	of the app we get the same IP in the response (Guten Tag aus 172.17.0.3)
	
	* http://localhost:9000/api/greeting
		Response: Hi from hola-springboot microservice built using Spring Boot from cluster hola-springboot at 
		host: 172.17.0.3 from cluster Backend at host: 172.17.0.8
	This /api/greeting API calls our backend and We can see that the backend pod returns its IP address (172.17.0.8) 
	in this call! So our service was discovered correctly, and all it took was a little bit of DNS and the power of 
	Kubernetes service discovery. Using Kubernetes cluster DNS provides a technology-agnostic way of doing basic 
	service discovery!
		
# The “readiness” quality of the hola-springboot pod will be determined by periodically polling the /health endpoint 
of our pod (This is done by Kubernetes). 
When we added the actuator to our Spring Boot microservice earlier, a /health endpoint was added which returns:
	{
	"diskSpace": {
	"free": 106880393216,
	Fault Tolerance
	|
	103"status": "UP",
	"threshold": 10485760,
	"total": 107313364992
	},
	"status": "UP"
	}
	namely, its necessary to add the actuator to add the /healt endpoint and then add the readiness probe to our kubernetes
	manifest, this is added automatically by adding the following Maven properties to the respective pom.xml (these were
	added automatically using the fabric8-setup command)
	
	<fabric8.readinessProbe.httpGet.path>/health</fabric8.readinessProbe.httpGet.path>
	<fabric8.readinessProbe.httpGet.port>8080</fabric8.readinessProbe.httpGet.port>
	<fabric8.readinessProbe.initialDelaySeconds>5</fabric8.readinessProbe.initialDelaySeconds>
	<fabric8.readinessProbe.timeoutSeconds>30</fabric8.readinessProbe.timeoutSeconds>

TESTING USING JMETER
	Jmeter stress test to a docker swarm cluster (part 1 - console monitor)
	
command to execute tests:

	apache-jmeter-3.2/bin/jmeter -n -t microservices/springBoot/redhat-microservices-by-example/hola-springboot/src/test/resources/jmeterConfigTest.jmx -l microservices/springBoot/redhat-microservices-by-example/hola-springboot/src/test/resources/result.jtl -e -o microservices/springBoot/redhat-microservices-by-example/hola-springboot/src/test/resources/dashboard/
	
theory to generate report dashboard in jmeter


	If you already have a .jtl result file you can do it like:

	jmeter -g /path/to/jtl/file -o /where/you/want/to/store/dashboard
	If you would like the dashboard to be generated after the test run, you can run JMeter in command-line non-GUI mode like:

	jmeter -n -t /path/to/testplan -l /path/to/result.jtl -e -o /path/to/dashboard/folder
	
	See Full list of command-line options for all possible JMeter command-line arguments listed and explained.
	http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html#options

	If above steps don't work - add the next lines to user.properties file (lives under "bin" folder of your JMeter installation)

	jmeter.save.saveservice.label=true
