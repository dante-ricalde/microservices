I need to code StoreInitializer and then application.yml, bootstrap.yml and starbucks.csv to connect to connect to the
config server, and then connect using the keystore to connect in a more secure way to the config server...
Then I need to test how the changes made in the config-repo are sent using the webhook to the config server using the
spring cloud bus and then how those changes are propagated to the client using RabbitMQ (the server will broadcast the message
and the clients will liston to those messages and updates when a configuration change event is transmitted.
Then continue with the Dockerfile

I need to continue StoreInitializer at line: lineMapper.setFieldSetMapper(StoreFieldSetMapper.INSTANCE); (100%)
I need to continue with application.yml (100%)
I need to continue with bootstrap.yml (100%)
