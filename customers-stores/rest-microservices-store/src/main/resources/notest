I need to code StoreInitializer and then application.yml, bootstrap.yml and starbucks.csv to connect to connect to the
config server, and then connect using the keystore to connect in a more secure way to the config server...
Then I need to test how the changes made in the config-repo are sent using the webhook to the config server using the
spring cloud bus and then how those changes are propagated to the client using RabbitMQ (the server will broadcast the message
and the clients will liston to those messages and updates when a configuration change event is transmitted.
Then continue with the Dockerfile

I need to continue StoreInitializer at line: lineMapper.setFieldSetMapper(StoreFieldSetMapper.INSTANCE); (100%)
I need to continue with application.yml (100%)
I need to continue with bootstrap.yml (100%)
I need to connect to my local config server wich points to my remote git account config-repo (100%) - tested with several
instances
I need to do the previous using docker
I need to increase the version of spring boot to 2.0.0.M3 and of spring cloud to Finchley.M2 to use Spring 5. I have tested
this versions before...work in everything ok...but the config server and the client don't work with these versions, I think
that I need to configure them another way
